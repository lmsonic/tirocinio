# Tirocinio

### Introduction 
- It’s a fast paced 3D game where you ride on a electric scooter throwing seed bombs to make the industrial city become livelier and solarpunk. Inspired by the 3D Sonic games from the Dreamcast era ( and other Sega games such as Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi).

### Explanation: 
- seed bombs are balls of clay, compost, seeds and water that you can throw or bury in the soil to make plants grow.

### Inspirations

- Sonic Adventure 2 Battle: City Escape
- Jet Set Radio HD [PC] Gameplay
- Freejack (2015) My Races (Brazil Server)
- Arcade Longplay [242] Crazy Taxi
- Sonic Riders

### Gameplay

Focus of the internship will be on the procedural generation aspect
-	Procedurally generated world, in hex tiles. The generation algorithm keeps the connections between tiles consistent

#### Gameplay verbs
-	Throw seed bombs
-	Collect batteries to recharge scooter
-	Grinding on rails
-	Tricks on ramps to get fuel
-	Braking
-	Jumping to get over obstacles
- Turbo mode for scooter, consumes more energy
-	Skidding like in kart games 
-	Going to next objective to seed bomb, with an indicator like in Crazy Taxi
-	Recharges battery once in next objective, to make the gameplay more fast paced
-	Upgrades/Customization of escooter and character

#### Objectives for seed bombing
How much area you cover is the final score , like in Splatoon’s competitive matches
-	Uncared areas 
-	Dry terrain
-	Polluted areas

When you seed bomb an area it shows visible changes in the environment (unrealistic, but gives instant feedback and satisfaction to the player)


#### Other entities in the city
-	Destructable objects when you go over them
-	Cars flying off like in Sonic Adventure 2’s City Escape (with a powerup, maybe?)
-	Passerbies who might see and call the police 
-	Police who tries to follow you and catch you
